# Code Quality Coach

The code quality coach is responsible for protecting our code bases against the types of decisions we have reason to believe will be regretted later.  This will entail surveying the department for what the better and worse coding practices are, ensuring everyone who contributes to a code base is sufficiently aware of coding practices to make informed decisions, and creating tooling to automatically detect unintentional deviations from what has been found to be good coding practices.  This will necessarily require knowledge of all programming languages used for code that needs to be maintained.

## Duties

Specific duties involve vetting, training, and tooling

### Vetting
- Solicit feedback from the department regarding coding practices
- Vet coding practices to determine their advantages and disadvantages
- Highlight cases where one coding practice is clearly better than another

### Training
- Prepare training materials
- Administer training
- Make training available to be self administered

### Tooling
- Create tooling to detect code quality issues
- Integrate tooling with our process to make sure code quality regressions are automatically detected
- Help department understand how to take advantage of tooling
