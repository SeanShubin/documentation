# Code Quality Coach

## Summary

The code quality coach is responsible for protecting code bases we maintain against the types of decisions we have reason to believe will be regretted later.  This will entail surveying the department for what the better and worse coding practices are, ensuring everyone who contributes to a code base is sufficiently aware of coding practices to make informed decisions, and where practical, creating tooling to automatically detect unintentional deviations from what has been found to be good coding practices.  This will necessarily require knowledge of all programming languages used for code that needs to be maintained.
