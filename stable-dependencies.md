## Stable

A module is stable if it rarely has reason to change

- This includes both actual changes, and changes that were deterred by the extra complexity of being in a separate project

Things that make a module more stable

- How rigorously it adheres to quality standards
- How many people have used it
- How long it has been in use
- How often it is used
- Having a bounded scope, and being complete within that scope
- Lack of superior alternatives, in spite of sufficient exploration

## Continuous Integration

continuous

- happens automatically upon pushing the change

integration

- merged into our "main" code base in a manner such that failures would be detected by wipeout
