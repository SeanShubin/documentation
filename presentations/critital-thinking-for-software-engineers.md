# Critical Thinking for Software Engineers
Same as regular critical thinking, except replace the word "idea" with "code"

## Why would we use critical thinking?
- Curious about an objective reality
- We deal with code that runs in an objective reality, where our opinion of how it should work is irrelevant to how it does work.
- In order to more effectively craft code that is easy to maintain, we need to differentiate between good and bad ways of coding.  


## Narrowing some definitions to the relevant context
- Claim
    - Something that can be true or false 
- Fact
    - True - in accordance with objective reality
    - Immutable - does not change
    - Independent - does not depend on whether we accept it
- Intelligence
    - The potential to comprehend
- Critical Thinking
    - Actively applied
    - Learned skill
    - Discipline
    - Allows us to evaluate with what confidence level we should accept or reject a claim

## When making or evaluating an argument, make sure you are clear about the argument structure
- Conclusion: Is the central claim clearly articulated?
- Premises: Are the supporting claims clearly articulated?
- Do the premises support the conclusion?
- Valid: Are the premises sufficient to accept the conclusion?
- Sound: Are the premises true?
- Not accepting an argument is not the same as claiming the conclusion is false
    - Just because a central claim is badly argued, does not mean its not true
    - Focus on providing better arguments, no matter what side you are on
    - The point is to make informed decisions

## Values 
- Disagreements that are seemingly a matter of personal opinion can actually be resolved by focusing on values
- Focus on explaining how code meets the criteria of values, rather than why you like or don't like it
- For example, ask how code meets the "Simplicity" criteria
- Attention to values takes the person out of the equation, and focuses on the code

## Simplicity
- Meet Customer Need
- Easy to Test
- Clearly Express Intent
- No Duplicate Code
- Concise as Possible

## You are not your code
- Criticising code is not criticising a person
- Any code is fair game, regardless of who wrote it
- Motivations of the coder are only relevant to the extent they align with values
- Other motivations of the coder are irrelevant, whether true or not, so don't bother speculating about them

## Descrepancies of factual claims should be verified, not argued
- Many claims are matters of verifiable fact, not opinion
- When practical, provide evidence or reasons for claims of fact
- The best evidence is the result of an experiment that demonstrates the fact of the matter

## Relevance
- Focus on the central claim of the discussion thread
- If you would like to discuss a different central claim, start a different thread

## Refinement
- There is nothing wrong with refining ones argument or central claim in response to criticism
- It is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of progress

## Cognative Biases
- Confirmation bias
- Overconfidence bias
    - 93% of Americans are better than average drivers
    - Ola Svenson - Are we all less risky and more skillful than our fellow drivers?
- Dunning–Kruger effect
    - Unskilled tend to overestimate their ability
    - Highly skilled tend to underestimate their ability, erroneously assuming that tasks that are easy for them also are easy for others.
    - Kruger, Justin; Dunning, David - Unskilled and unaware of it: How difficulties in recognizing one's own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments.
    - "The trouble with ignorance is that it feels so much like expertise." -DAVID DUNNING  OCT 27, 2014

## Fear of ignorance
- Especially fear of appearing ignorant

## Beware Logical Fallacies 
- strawman
    - argue against a claim that was not made
    - your first task should be to ensure you have the same understanding of the argument as the person making it
- false cause
    - a common result of confirmation bias
    - be sure to check your causal assumptions with experiment
- appeal to emotion
    - reality does not care what you think about it
    - wanting something to be true does nothing to change the fact of the matter
- the fallacy fallacy
    - a badly argued claim is not necessarily false
    - focus on fixing the problems with the argument
    - then re-evaluate the fact of the matter
- slippery slope
    - a variant of strawman
    - be sure to focus on the claim at hand
    - not an extreme version of the claim that is not actually being argued
- ad hominem
    - be critical of ideas and code
    - do not tear down the person with the ideas or who wrote the code
    - it is ok to talk about motivations to the extent they involve values
    - other motivations are irrelevant, whether true or not 
- tu quoque
    - another variant of strawman
    - pointing out a flaw in an opposing claim is not the same as strengthing your claim
    - your argument should stand on its own
- personal incredulity
    - just because you don't understand how something can work does not mean it will not work
    - focus on learning how the claim is intended to work so you can have an informed discussion
- special pleading
    - once an experiment proves/disproves a claim
    - use that to advance your understanding
    - don't rationalize why the experiment is wrong
- loaded question
    - be clear about what your central claim is and what your supporting premises are
    - don't try to slip in a claim as if it were a premise that goes without saying
- burden of proof
    - if it is your idea, you need to provide the reasons and evidence for it
    - failure to disprove your idea is not support for it 
- ambiguity
    - use precision in your terminology
    - don't change what you mean by same word in the same argument
- the gambler's fallacy
    - understand the factors involved in determining the odds of something
    - do not assume the odds change just because previous events turned out in a particular way
- bandwagon
    - something being popular does not make it correct
    - make sure you understand why something is better
- appeal to authority
    - something being endorsed by authority does not make it correct
    - make sure you understand why something is better
- composition/​division
    - what is true of a part is not necessarily true of what the parts compose
    - what is true of a thing is not necessarily true of its parts
- no true scotsman
    - counter-examples need to be addressed, not defined away
- genetic
    - the origin of something does not necessarily relate to what it is now
- black-or-white
    - do not presume only 2 alternatives exist without good reason
- begging the question
    - don't use your conclusion as one of its own reasons
- appeal to nature
    - just because it is natural does not make it better
- anecdotal
    - isolated events are not sufficient to conclude general pattern
    - find underlying reasons and evidence to explain the events
- the texas sharpshooter
    - follow the evidence where it leads
    - don't cherry pick evidence that happens to support a particular conclusion
- middle ground
    - the truth is rarely half way between two extremes 
    - find the actual fact of the matter
    - don't assume the answer must be in between the alternatives, one of them could actually be right and the other wrong
