# Maintainability
- This is what I think is the most important concept in order to write maintainable code
- Separate the parts you do control from the parts you don't

# Context
- We are talking about the code you are writing

# What you control
- Defined by the rules of your programming language
- Conditional logic, loops
- Anything referentially transparent

# What you don't control
- Network
- File system
- System clock
- Launching the process
