# Critical Thinking

## Why use critical thinking
- Curiosity - You want to know if an idea is true or false
- Objective Reality - You want your knowledge to be accurate

## Process
- Start with claims, assertions, statements - ideas that could be true or false
- Evaluate with reasoning and evidence
- End up with conclusion and confidence level

## Desired Outcome
- Level of certainty is proportional to the level of evidence as interpreted by reason
- Certainty without reason/evidence is delusion, making a type 1 error likely
- Lack of certainty in spite of reason/evidence is denial, making type 2 error likely

## Deductive reasoning
- reach specific conclusions from general ideas

## Inductive reasoning
- make generalizations from specific observations

## Argument
- If premises are true, conclusion must be tue
- An argument is valid if true premises guarantee a true conclusion
- An argument is sound if it is valid and its premises are true

## Deconstructing into an argument
- facts
    - figure out which statements are matters of fact
    - do not argue about these, verify them experimentally
- opinions
    - figure out which statements are matters of opinion
    - these are useless, dig for the reasoning behind the opinions
- values
    - a disagreement may come from differing values
    - identify these and put them in priority order, see if each person has a different priority
