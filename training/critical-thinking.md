# Critical Thinking
An essential tool for any software engineer

## Tips
- Don't automatically believe anything anyone tells you, but listen with an open mind
- Don't automatically believe documentation, but use documentation as a guide to discover the fact of the matter for yourself
- Don't debug to fix, debug to gain information until the root problem is obvious
- Make sure you understand an idea before you challenge it
- Challenge ideas in the form of a question (How do you know that? As compared to what? At what cost?)
- Intelligence is no defense against bad ideas, as it allows one to create elaborate rationalizations for ideas that can’t even address common sense objections.
- Avoid ignorance, consider what you can know in spite of incomplete or unreliable information
- Avoid dogmatism, if knowing something makes you feel smarter, superior, more righteous, or more worthy of membership in a group, it is time to question why you believe it.
- Be suspicious of knowledge that comes easily, to truly understand something takes work
- Avoid delusion, do the work it takes to justify your certainty
- Avoid denial, consider the reasons and evidence for what you find hard to believe
- An insightful idea is forged in the fire of opposition.  It relies on others to disagree with you, forcing you to either express your idea with sufficient precision that it has value, or discover that your idea was not worth keeping after all.
- Suppressing opposing ideas makes your own ideas weaker, even incorrect opposition make good ideas stronger for having had to address the objection.
- Evaluate the merit of an idea independently of the individual expressing it
- Judging is not inherently bad.  If you are not judging some ideas as better than others, you are not thinking critically
- Judging is not inherently good.  If you do not have justification behind your judgements, you are not thinking critically
- Being good at critical thinking in one area does not imply being good at it in another
- Bias is not inherently bad.  Bias is only a problem when isolated to an echo chamber with only similar biases, or when it is not open to revision when exposed to new ideas.
- You don’t have ideas, ideas have you.  It takes work to internalize the justification for your ideas.  Without this work, you are stuck with a head full of ideas that came from the blind chance of whatever you happen to have been exposed to first.
- Critical thinking is a social activity, it requires pushback from others who don't think the way you do.

## Traps
- Dunning–Kruger effect
- Confirmation bias
- Selection bias
- Regression to the Mean
