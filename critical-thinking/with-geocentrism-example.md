# Critical Thinking

While critical thinking is useful in all aspects of your life, there is no escaping the explicit need for it in software engineering.
I will talk about what critical thinking is for, how to tell if you are thinking critically, and how easy it is to fool yourself into thinking you are thinking critically when you are not. 

## What critical thinking is for
- Reliably gaining knowledge about objective reality
- Justified True Belief

### Example
How many of you know if the earth goes around the sun, or if the sun goes around the earth?
- Not a trick question
    - One of these answers is true, the other is false
- I am talking about actual revolution, not wobbling
- Use a straightforward reference frame (outside the solar system)

Which is it?

How do you know that?

Did anyone mention parallax?
- Close, but initial measurements of parallax matched a heliocentric model because they did not account for how far away the stars were

Did anyone mention aberration of light?
- If you can explain what that means and how it can be used to test if we are in a geocentric or heliocentric system, then congratulations, you have knowledge.

It is not knowledge unless your belief is justified.

### Example, explained
- Claudius Ptolemy (100 - 170)
    - Created a model of nested spheres with epicycles, that could predict the positions of planets
- Nicolaus Copernicus (February 19, 1473 - May 24, 1543)
    - Created a model where the earth went around the sun, that could predict the positions of planets just as well without epicycles
- Tycho Brahe (December 14, 1546 - October 24, 1601)
    - Comprehensively and precisely recorded the positions of stars and planets
- Johannes Kepler (December 27, 1571 - November 15, 1630)
    - Developed laws of planetary motion
        - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
        - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.[1]
        - The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
- Isaac Newton (January 4, 1643 - March 31, 1727)
    - Law of universal gravitation
- James Bradley (March 1693 - July 13, 1762)
    - Tried to measure parallax, instead discovered aberration of light
- Friedrich Bessel (July 22, 1784 - March 17, 1846)    
    - Successfully measured stellar parallax in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a heliometer
- Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 - April 18, 1955)
    - Observations of stellar aberration influenced his theory of special relativity

What was necessary to figure this out?
- people biased towards their own ideas
- biases that are sufficiently varied
- willingness to communicate to understand each-others ideas
- doing the work to determine the fact of the matter

If you don't do the work, what you have is not knowledge, what you have instead is someone else's idea.
Critical thinking is about having your own ideas.

Don't take this to mean you have to critically evaluate every single idea.
This presentation happened to be the first occasion I had reason to evaluate the heliocentric claim critically.
The important thing is to know difference between ideas you have claimed for yourself, and ideas someone else has put in your head, that you have not yet claimed as knowledge or debunked as wrong.  

## What critical thinking is
- Disciplined Curiosity
- don't accept ignorance, push for discovery
- don't accept ideas easily, do the work to verify them
- judgmental, ideas are ranked against each other
- methodological naturalism
    - great at discovering the rules of objective reality
    - vulnerable to intentional deception
    - sometimes a magician is more qualified to evaluate a claim than a scientist

## What critical thinking is not

- documentation
- dictionary
- wikipedia
- internet search
- being intelligent
- saying the people with opposing ideas are bad (evil, stupid, ignorant, etc.)
- silencing ideas (the silenced idea is unlikely to be what you think it is)
- considerate of feelings
- loyalty to a group
- [echo chambers](echo-chambers.jpg)
- [dunning kruger effect](dunning-kruger-effect.jpg)

## Cognitive Bias
- all of us have them
    - confirmation bias
    - backfire effect
    - language ambiguity
- very difficult to think critically alone, note the heliocentric model was shown to be true because of opposing biases
- seek out alternative, even opposing ideas
- to make progress, you need the courage to explore ideas that could turn out to be wrong

## Conclusion
- Your mind is both capable and vulnerable
- Critical thinking is hard work, don't trust easily obtained certainty
- Listen to the ideas of others, but don't believe them until you have evaluated them on your own
- If you don't understand alternatives to your ideas and the reasons to choose your idea instead, then you don't understand your idea. 
- the goal is to not be fooled, and the easiest person to fool is yourself
- Maintain certainty proportional to evidence
