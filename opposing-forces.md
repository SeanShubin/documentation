# Opposing Forces

## Duplication vs. Coupling
- Duplication: You have to make changes in multiple places
- Coupling: Your changes impact multiple places

## Versioned Modules vs. Continuous Integration
- Versioned Modules: Merge hell, build complexity
- Continuous Integration: Ever growing code base

## Consistency vs. Leading Edge
- Consistency: Only have to learn one way of doing something
- Leading Edge: Get to use latest way of doing something

## Productivity vs. Maintainability
- Productivity: Get a lot done now, new features constantly increase in cost
- Maintainablity: Get less done now, new features have reasonable cost

## Performance vs. Durability
- Performance: keep in in memory
- Durability: write it to disk

## Off the shelf vs. Write your own
- Write your own: Exactly match need
- Off the shelf: 

## Consistency vs. Availability (when you have multiple Partitions)
- Consistency: The data is up-to-date
- Availability: The data is immediately available
